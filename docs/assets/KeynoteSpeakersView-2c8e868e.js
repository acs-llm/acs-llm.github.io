This talk explores Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) as a new direction for judgment tasks, like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1. We present JudgeLRM, a family of LLM judges trained via reinforcement learning with outcome-driven rewards, which significantly outperforms SFT and state-of-the-art models, especially on tasks requiring deep reasoning. We also examine judgment biases in LRMs, uncovering issues like position and authority bias, as well as a novel “superficial reflection bias.” Despite strong reasoning ability, LRMs remain vulnerable to such biases.

The high modeling power a large DNN mainly stems from its increasing complexity (having more neuron layers and more neuron operators in each layer) and dynamicity (frequently activating/deactivating neuron operators in each layer during training, such as Neural Architecture Search, or NAS). Such complexity and dynamicity can easily make a large DNN exceed the computing and memory capacities of a modern GPU, so training a large DNN often often needs to split the DNN into many GPUs via multiple dimensions, including data parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. Dr. Cui’s talk will present his recent papers (e.g., [PipeMesh, in revision of a journal], [Fold3D TPDS 2023], [NASPipe ASPLOS 2022], and [vPipe TPDS 2021]), which address major limitations in existing multi-dimensional parallel training systems, including GPipe, Pipedream, and Megatron. For instance, vPipe focuses on addressing the severe load imbalance and low GPU computing utilization; NASPipe will present Supernet parallelism, a new parallel training dimension for highly dynamic large DNNs designed in the Supernet manners (e.g., Evolved Transformer and Neural Architecture Search).
